## Installation

### Prerequisites

- .NET 8.0 or later
- Jellyfin server with webhook plugin installed
- AniList account(s) with API access tokens
- (Optional) Sonarr instance for automatic library refreshes

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AtaraxyState/JellyfinAnilistSync.git
   cd JellyfinAnilistSync
   ```

2. **Build the application**
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

3. **Run for first time to generate config**
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

4. **Configure the application**
   - Edit `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\JellyfinAnilistSync\config.json`
   - Add your Jellyfin server details and AniList tokens

5. **Set up Jellyfin webhooks**
   - Install the webhook plugin in Jellyfin
   - Configure webhooks to send to your application URL
   - Enable events: `UserDataSaved`, `AuthenticationSuccess`

## Configuration

### Configuration File Location

The application automatically determines the best location for the configuration file:

1. **Custom Path**: If `CONFIG_PATH` environment variable is set, uses that location
2. **User Documents**: `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\JellyfinAnilistSync\config.json` (default)
3. **USERPROFILE Fallback**: `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\JellyfinAnilistSync\config.json` (for services)
4. **Application Directory**: `[app-directory]\config\config.json` (last resort)

The application will create a default configuration file if none exists and log which location it's using.

### Configuration Structure

```json
{
  "jellyfin": {
    "serverUrl": "http://your-jellyfin-server:8096",
    "apiKey": "your-jellyfin-api-key"
  },
  "aniList": {
    "globalToken": "fallback-anilist-token",
    "userTokens": {
      "JellyfinUsername1": "anilist-token-1",
      "JellyfinUsername2": "anilist-token-2"
    },
    "userAutoAdd": {
      "JellyfinUsername1": true,
      "JellyfinUsername2": false
    },
    "userBulkUpdate": {
      "JellyfinUsername1": true,
      "JellyfinUsername2": false
    }
  },
  "webhook": {
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 5000
  },
  "sonarr": {
    "enabled": false,
    "refreshJellyfinOnImport": true,
    "apiKey": ""
  },
  "libraryNames": ["Animes", "Anime"]
}
```

### Getting AniList API Tokens

1. Go to [AniList Developer Settings](https://anilist.co/settings/developer)
2. Create a new API client
3. Generate access tokens for each user

### User Settings

#### Auto-Add Settings (`userAutoAdd`)

Each user can control whether anime should be automatically added to their AniList:

- `true` (default): Automatically adds anime to AniList when first encountered
- `false`: Only updates progress for anime already in the user's list

If auto-add is disabled and an anime isn't in the user's list, the sync will fail with a helpful error message.

#### Bulk Update Settings (`userBulkUpdate`)

Each user can control whether their entire library should be synced on login:

- `true`: Triggers full library sync when user logs into Jellyfin
- `false` (default): Only individual episode changes are synced

Bulk updates can be resource-intensive and take time, so they default to disabled.

### Environment Variables

The application supports these environment variables:

- `CONFIG_PATH`: Custom path to config.json file (useful for services)
- `ASPNETCORE_URLS`: Override webhook listening URLs (e.g., `http://0.0.0.0:5001`)

Examples:
```bash
# Set custom config location
set CONFIG_PATH=C:\MyConfigs\jellyfin-anilist-sync.json

# Override listening address
set ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://0.0.0.0:5001
```

### Getting Jellyfin API Key

1. Go to Jellyfin Admin Dashboard
2. Navigate to API Keys
3. Create a new API key for the sync application

## How It Works

1. **Episode Watched**: When you mark an episode as watched in Jellyfin, it updates your AniList progress
2. **Episode Unwatched**: When you unmark an episode, it syncs your overall series progress to AniList
3. **User Login**: When a configured user logs into Jellyfin, it performs a bulk sync of their entire anime library
4. **Smart Matching**: Uses AniList provider IDs from Jellyfin metadata, or falls back to name-based search
5. **Missing Series**: Tracks anime that couldn't be matched for manual review in `missing_anilist_series.json`

## Sonarr Integration (Optional)

Sonarr integration enables automatic Jellyfin library refreshes when new episodes are imported, ensuring immediate availability without waiting for scheduled scans.

### Sonarr Configuration

1. **Enable in Config**:
   ```json
   {
     "sonarr": {
       "enabled": true,
       "refreshJellyfinOnImport": true,
       "apiKey": ""  // Optional for authentication /!\ not working yet /!\
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Configure Sonarr Webhook**:
   - Go to Sonarr Settings → Connect
   - Add new Webhook connection
   - **URL**: `http://your-service-host:5000/sonarr`
   - **Method**: POST
   - **Triggers**: Select "On Import/Upgrade"
   - **Authentication**: Leave empty (unless you set an API key)

### How It Works

1. **Sonarr imports episode** → Sends webhook to service
2. **Service receives webhook** → Extracts TVDB ID from series info
3. **Find matching series** → Searches Jellyfin for series with same TVDB ID  
4. **Trigger refresh** → Calls Jellyfin `/Items/{seriesId}/Refresh` API
5. **Jellyfin scans for new episode** → Episode appears immediately in library

### Benefits

- **Immediate availability**: New episodes appear instantly in Jellyfin
- **Reduced server load**: Only refreshes specific series, not entire library
- **Seamless workflow**: Sonarr → Jellyfin → AniList sync happens automatically

## Running as a Service

Using the .bat should work atm, it will add service, and then ask you for config variables, like API key, Users and adresses.

Else you can manually install the service following these steps:

```bash
# Build and publish
dotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish

# Install as service with NSSM (update paths to match your system)
nssm install JellyfinAnilistSync "C:\Program Files\dotnet\dotnet.exe" "C:\path\to\your\publish\JellyfinAnilistSync.dll"

# Set working directory to where config.json is located
nssm set JellyfinAnilistSync AppDirectory "C:\path\to\your\publish"

# Optional: Set startup type to automatic
nssm set JellyfinAnilistSync Start SERVICE_AUTO_START

# Start the service
nssm start JellyfinAnilistSync
```

The application will automatically find your configuration using the location priority described above.

### Service Configuration Options

```bash
# Optional: Override URL via environment variable
nssm set JellyfinAnilistSync AppEnvironmentExtra ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://0.0.0.0:5001

# Optional: Set custom config location (useful for services)
nssm set JellyfinAnilistSync AppEnvironmentExtra CONFIG_PATH="C:\custom\path\config.json"
```

### Troubleshooting Service Configuration

If the service can't find your configuration file, check the Windows Event Log or service logs. The application will log which configuration path it's using:

- ✅ `📁 Using Documents folder: C:\Users\[User]\Documents\JellyfinAnilistSync`
- ✅ `📁 Using USERPROFILE Documents: C:\Users\[User]\Documents\JellyfinAnilistSync`
- ⚠️ `📁 Using application directory fallback: D:\Path\To\App\config`

For services that can't access user profiles, you can:

1. **Use custom config path**: Set `CONFIG_PATH` environment variable
2. **Copy config to app directory**: Place `config.json` in the publish folder

### Service Logging

Configure NSSM to capture application logs for easier debugging:

```bash
# Create the log directory first
mkdir "C:\Logs\JellyfinAnilistSync"

# Set up log files (run as Administrator)
nssm set JellyfinAnilistSync AppStdout "C:\Logs\JellyfinAnilistSync\stdout.log"
nssm set JellyfinAnilistSync AppStderr "C:\Logs\JellyfinAnilistSync\stderr.log"
```

### Monitoring Logs

Monitor service logs in real-time using PowerShell:

```powershell
# Monitor stdout log (application output)
Get-Content "C:\Logs\JellyfinAnilistSync\stdout.log" -Wait -Tail 20

# Monitor stderr log (errors)
Get-Content "C:\Logs\JellyfinAnilistSync\stderr.log" -Wait -Tail 20

# Monitor both logs simultaneously (requires PowerShell 7+)
Get-Content "C:\Logs\JellyfinAnilistSync\stdout.log", "C:\Logs\JellyfinAnilistSync\stderr.log" -Wait -Tail 10
```

**Alternative**: The application also logs to Windows Event Log, viewable in Event Viewer under **Windows Logs → Application**.

### Service Management

```bash
# Check service status
nssm status JellyfinAnilistSync

# Stop the service
nssm stop JellyfinAnilistSync

# Remove the service
nssm remove JellyfinAnilistSync confirm
```
